This website is designed to replace a tiresome due approval process for graduating students of IIT Guwahati. Students can log in with their IITG Outlook accounts. Library/CC, Gymkhana and HOD's will be given their own accounts. Labs and BTP professors will have to create accounts and get them approved by their respective HOD's. Students can send due approval requests to campus institutions. These requests can be accepted or rejected. Lab and BTP requests need another approval by the HOD of their department.
Request approvals and rejections can be done with the use of CSV file processing. The Academic Affairs office can see the status of all accounts. Emails are sent notifying the status of all requests being sent, accepted or rejected to both the sender of requests and the receiver of requests/
Here are a few screenshots from the website:
